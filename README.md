# FerrisCraft Dependencies
This repository contains downloaded dependencies which FerrisCraft depends on,
for the purpose of inclusion into a Modrinth pack.

Modrinth requires files outside of a `.mrpack` file to be located on one of a few
different hosts, GitHub being one. That is the purpose of this repository.

In particular, this contains Vanilla Tweaks resource and data packs!
Thank you [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/), you all are awesome.
